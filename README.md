# Software Design From Scratch

This repository contains implementations of various software design concepts and tools built from scratch. The goal is to deeply understand these concepts by implementing them with minimal dependencies, revealing how they work under the hood.

## Why Build From Scratch?

Building core concepts from scratch helps to:

- Gain deeper understanding of fundamental principles
- Demystify "magic" in software libraries and frameworks
- Learn how to make better design decisions in your own code
- Appreciate the elegance of well-designed software systems

## Projects

### [Object-Oriented Programming from Scratch](./oop/README.md)

A minimal implementation of OOP principles using only Python dictionaries and functions. This project demonstrates inheritance, polymorphism, and method dispatch without using Python's built-in class system.
